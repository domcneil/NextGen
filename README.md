# NextGen
This repositiory is dedicated to demonstrating my final project for the Next Gen professionals ServiceNow externship
 

For my final project as a NextGen ServiceNow extern, my group mates and I created a scoped application using Studio. 

<strong>We:</strong>
- <strong>Created a dashboard populated with automated reports, a catalog with various items, and knowledge bases with corresponding articles</strong>
- <strong>Further enhanced our project by:</strong>
    -  Creating a catalog ui policy that applies to a variable set used on our record producer for placing plant consultation requests
    - Created a phone number regular expression customizing code after researching the ServiceNow community
    - Used a dictionary override to automatically populate the due date to be +3 days from the date of submission
- <strong>Created an assignment rule to automate assigning customer store employee group to assignment group field for consultation requests</strong>
- <strong>Utilized flow designer to: </strong>
    - Automate customer notifications when they submit a plant inquiry request 
    - Automate The Plant Shop catalog item orders fulfillment and deployment process, including emails to customers when a new order is received and after their order has been shipped
- <strong> Created a Service Portal in which we:</strong> 
    - Used widget editor to clone and configure icon link widgets to improve customer UI experience and aesthetic value
    - Created a custom header and footer 
    - Used a Carousel widget on Service Portal catalog that linked to various items including knowledge articles, catalog items, and record producers


*We do not own the photos featured on our portal, however a group member (Tiffany Ruff) created the lettering that reads 'Pot it Like it's Hot' over the background on the index page
